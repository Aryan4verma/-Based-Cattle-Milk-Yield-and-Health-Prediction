# -Based-Cattle-Milk-Yield-and-Health-Prediction
AI/ML-based cattle monitoring platform predicts milk yield and detects diseases early. Using data on breed, feed, activity, health, and environment, it provides yield forecasts, disease alerts, and preventive recommendations via a farmer-friendly dashboard with exportable reports.

Milk Yield Prediction (Regression Model):

Estimates daily milk output of each cow.

Uses factors such as breed, age, lactation stage, feed type/quantity, activity level, weather, and past yield records.

Helps farmers optimize feed, plan logistics, and maximize production.

Disease Detection (Classification Model):

Identifies health issues that reduce milk yield (e.g., mastitis, digestive disorders, mineral deficiency).

Analyzes data like veterinary records, vaccination history, body temperature, heart rate, and behavioral changes.

Provides alerts for early disease detection and preventive actions.

Data Inputs:

Animal data: Breed, age, weight, lactation stage, calving history.

Feed data: Type/quantity of feed, supplements, feeding frequency.

Activity data: Walking distance, grazing time, resting/rumination hours.

Health data: Veterinary history, vaccination, diseases, vital signs.

Environmental data: Temperature, humidity, housing conditions, seasons.

Frontend Dashboard (Web/Mobile):

User-friendly interface for data entry.

Shows milk yield predictions and disease alerts.

Provides preventive/corrective health recommendations.

Reports & Insights:

Exports farm-level reports (CSV/Excel/PDF).

Includes milk yield trends, feed usage, animal health history, and disease risks.

Assists in decision-making for feed planning, disease prevention, and productivity improvement.
